                <p>Unlike other students in Taiwan, I quitted my university because I didn't like the system in my
                    univeristy and country that your final scores depended on the tests and the quizzes 100%, and I
                    always wanted to be a <abbr title="Project Manager">PM</abbr> when I grew up; however, the school
                    could not teach me about it. After that, I decided to have a job first; however, it was a hard time
                    to find a job during covid. As for that, I chose to served the compulsory military to have something
                    to do and some income. Although it was a hard time, I did learn a lot of things that sometimes I
                    should give something a shoot instead of saying no. After finishing my service, I had a choice to go
                    back to my university, find a job, or study abroad, and I told myself why not.</p>

                <p>I arrived in Canada last December, and that was the first time that I saw snow in person. As most of
                    the international students, I came to Canada to study English first, and I chose my languang school
                    in Toronto. It was a wonderful and unforgettable journey in my life that I had made a lot of friends
                    from different countries and gone to many different resorts. It was a stunned experience that I
                    could exchange culture, food, weather, and hobbies with other people from different countries, and I
                    had tried Latin food in my first time, <em>one of my favorite is <b>Cachapas</b></em>, it is a
                    pancake with butter on it ,and I chose beef as my ingredient. The other dish that impressed me the
                    most was steak with lobster from <b>Chuck's Roadhouse Bar & Grill</b> When it comes to escorts in
                    Toronto, it would be imcomplete without mention to <b>Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario</b>. I would
                    say that these two place were my favorite place in Toronto, not only because of the astonished views
                    but also the atmosphere around them.</p>

            <p>After finishing my language school, I moved to Quebec on August 8<sup>th</sup> and met my distant
                relative. I had never met her before I came to Canada which is a pretty special experience. During that
                period, I had gone to Gatineau Park and had a trip to her friend's house was one of the best trip during
                summer vacation. Although the place that we stayed was not interesting at all, the view around it broke
                my expections that we could use the river as a mirrior to see reversed image, also we built camp fire at
                night to had a barbecue. More than that, I could finally fulfill one of my dream that I could have a dog
                because I hadn't has a chance to have one when I was in Taiwan. He's a foody every time when we had
                meal, he always came to visit everyone and begged everyone to give him food which was so funny. </p>
